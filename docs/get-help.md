You can see <a href="https://github.com/maximshumilo/fastapi-restful-extension/issues" class="external-link" target="_blank">existing issues</a> and try and help others, most of the times they are questions that you might already know the answer for. 🤓

* Suggest a new **feature**.

## Join the chat

Join the 👥 <a href="https://discord.gg/VQjSZaeJmf" class="external-link" target="_blank">Discord chat server</a> 👥 and hang out with others in the FastAPI community.

### Don't use the chat for questions

Have in mind that as chats allow more "free conversation", it's easy to ask questions that are too general and more difficult to answer, so, you might not receive answers.

In GitHub issues the template will guide you to write the right question so that you can more easily get a good answer, or even solve the problem yourself even before asking. And in GitHub I can make sure I always answer everything, even if it takes some time. I can't personally do that with the chat systems. 😅

Conversations in the chat systems are also not as easily searchable as in GitHub, so questions and answers might get lost in the conversation. And only the ones in GitHub issues count to become a [FastAPI Expert](fastapi-people.md#experts){.internal-link target=_blank}, so you will most probably receive more attention in GitHub issues.

On the other side, there are thousands of users in the chat systems, so there's a high chance you'll find someone to talk to there, almost all the time. 😄
